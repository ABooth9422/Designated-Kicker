> In recent years, Kickstarter’s research has shown that as the role of innovation in our lives and society has expanded, people’s expectations for “the next big thing” has evolved. As always, Kickstarters must provide a reliable product and a rewarding customer experience. But now investors have many more reasons to question how much they trust your startup. Will it protect their data and privacy? Use automation responsibly? Tell the truth in this era of disinformation? In short: Can investors trust an innovator do the right thing?
